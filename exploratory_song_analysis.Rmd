This project will focus on classification of songs by artists. The goal is to 
utilize both supervised and unsupervised methods.

To begin, we shall define some terms. By NLP standards, the lyrics of a song 
will be referred to as `document`, the set of all song lyrics will be referred 
to as the `corpus`. The artist name will act as the `label` for the purpose of 
this project.

As far as limitations go, to begin with, these methods would be better suited
for classifying by genre, however those labels are not available at the time.

We begin by reading in our dataset and selecting the `artist` and `text` columns
as those are the `label` and `corpus` sets, respectively.

```{r}
song_dataset <- read.csv("spotify_millsongdata.csv")[c('artist', 'text')]
```

The first step is to perform some form of word embedding. We will attempt two
different methods, `bag of words` and `tf-idf`.
